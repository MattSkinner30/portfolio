      Wingman is an app designed to work with a wearable smart product. Paired with a smartwatch, it helps you track your Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC).
    </p>
    <p class="work-p">
      Theoretically, using the sun-dermal scanner on the back of your smartwatch, Wingman can calculate your BAC by analysing your sweat. It was designed to provide awareness to ensure users can get home safely.

    The home screen features a simple UI, which gives you information at a glance. Wingman will potentially be used while under the unfluence, so getting the point across quickly and boldly is important.

  <figcaption class="additional-images additional-caption">
    The flow for the watch version is heavily simplified. It only has the home screen, and the alarm system. Since space is limited, many feature are not usable or not needed.
