      The challenge of this project was to create a 5 second animation themed around "play".
    </p>
    <p class="work-p">
      Rotoscopeing is based on footage, where certain elements are drawn frame by frame to give a hand drawn look, yet have realistic motion. Speeing up the original footage to only a second allowed me to create this rapid fire animation.

    The final product has a colour scheme of mainly warm colours, with blue and grey to act as lighlights. The hand drawn feel of this style of animation really emphasizes the motion.
