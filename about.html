      Hey there, I'm a Graphic Designer from Ottawa. UI/UX design and branding are my favourite areas of design.
      <br>
      I started my art carrer in a one year program for Fine Arts. This was pretty cool, and it gave me a great basis and eye for what looks good and what doesn't. I took this knowledge with me into Graphic Design, where I found out what I <i>really</i> loved to do.
