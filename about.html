    <p class="about-p">
      <span class="hey-there">Hey there,</span> I'm a <strong>Graphic Designer from Ottawa.</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="about-p">
      I started my art carrer in a one year program for Fine Arts. This was pretty cool, and it gave me a great basis and eye for what looks good and what doesn't. I took this knowledge with me into Graphic Design, where I found out what I <i>really</i> loved to do.
    </p>

    <p class="about-p">
      Graphic Design was a great way to take my creative urges and not only make some pretty rad stuff, but create stuff in a market that was financially viable. I quickly fell in love with UX design. I liked it because I liked solving real problems. I like making things that I could see people actually using. Also, it's something that I was pretty good at right from the start. As we learned about UX design, I was able to formalize the thoughts I had and the patterns I had noticed in day to day user interfaces. This also came with the curse of noticing all the really bad ones out there.
    </p>

    <p class="about-p">
      Motion design was another beast all together. I remember how excited I was to learn motion on the first day of class. This was until I realized how shitty I was at actually making things move. This was the firt time in my 17 years of education that I couldn't make anything I liked, no matter how hard I tried.
    </p>

    <p class="about-p">
      I started really getting it when I would animate my UX projects, because this was something that I understood and could make work. Over time, this taught me tons about the principles of motion, curves, easing and many other things I could take and apply to other aspects of motion. Making Wingman was when it really clicked, that "ah hah" moment when you get it, and it's all been gravy since.
