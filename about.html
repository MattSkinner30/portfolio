    <p class="about-p">
      I started my art carrer in a one year program for Fine Arts. This was pretty cool, and it gave me a great basis and eye for what looks good and what doesn't. I took this knowledge with me into Graphic Design, where I found out what I <i>really</i> loved to do.
    </p>

    <p class="about-p">
      Graphic Design was a great way to take my creative urges and not only make some pretty rad stuff, but create stuff in a market that was financially viable. I quickly fell in love with UI and UX design. Creating a clean and functional app flow, or a pretty app icon was just so satisfying.
