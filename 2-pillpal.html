      PillPal is an app that is designed to partner with the PillPal smart canister. It will help users manage and track their prescriptions.
    </p>
    <p class="work-p">
      The first step is to find a target audience. In this case, the topic and preliminary research was done by someone else, and then I picked it up at the design phase. I was looking at designing for a very broad audience, with a large demographic of older users. This means the app needs to be simple and easy to use.
    </p>
    <p class="work-p">
      I designed PillPal to only have two main screens and functions. The list of medications is one page, and the second is a more detailed information page of each medication. The reminders, dosage and duration are all set by the doctor.
