      I spent 6 week working as part of a team of interns at You.i TV to create Viper League, a soccer streaming app. I worked with <a href="http://www.ashtastic.ca">Ashley Murray</a> and <a href="http://kylejackson.me/">Kyle Jackson</a> to bring this design from concept to a functional application. We were tasked to create an app for You.i TV's Engine One, a highly customizeable app running off of their engine. We created the brand, designed the app and brought it to life.

      This was a great experience and I really learned a lot about working with a team and in a proffesional space and workflow.

    This is the flow of Viper League. The four main sections are Recaps, Matches, Stats and Standings. Recaps will show you just that, a recap for each game that has taken place in the past week. Matches are where you can find full games, sorted by pre-game, live game or post game. Stats will show you statistics on either players or teams, which you can switch between, and Standings will show you the which teams hold the top 5 spots.

    Here is an example of what our wireframes would look live. We went through many iterations and flows to really boil down what needed to be there.
