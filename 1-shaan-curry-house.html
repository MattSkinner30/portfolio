      The goal of this project was to re-brand a local business. I chose Shaan Curry House, a traditional Indian food restaurant.
    </p>
    <p class="work-p">
      Shaan Curry House originally had very unconsistant branding. I took the approach I did to give it a more modern feel, but still keep the sense that it is a traditional Indian restaurant. I created an entire branding guide, which contains everything from the phtoography uses to the web design.

    The concept of the logo went through many cycles and refinements, and a ton of sketches. This is the final logo. It features some elements of traditinal Indian design, while still being clean and modern. It reduces well, and the structure of the house will always be visible.

    Part of this branding assignment was to design the visual design of their website. It gives you all the basic information at a glance, as well as a call to action (the order now button).
