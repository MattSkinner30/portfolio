      The goal of this project was to re-brand a local business. I chose Shaan Curry House, a traditional Indian food restaurant.
    </p>
    <p class="work-p">
      Shaan Curry House originally had very unconsistant branding. I took the approach I did to give it a more modern feel, but still keep the sense that it is a traditional Indian restaurant. I created an entire branding guide, which contains everything from the phtoography uses to the web design.
